## 🎓 Key Learning Points

### 📈 **Big-O Notation Hierarchy**
```
O(1) < O(log N) < O(N) < O(N log N) < O(N²) < O(N³) < O(2^N) < O(N!)
```

### 🧮 **Common Complexity Patterns**
- **O(1)**: Array access, hash table lookup
- **O(log N)**: Binary search, balanced tree operations
- **O(N)**: Linear search, single loop
- **O(N log N)**: Efficient sorting (merge sort, heap sort)
- **O(N²)**: Nested loops, naive sorting algorithms
- **O(2^N)**: Recursive algorithms without memoization

### 💡 **Optimization Tips**
1. **Identify bottlenecks**: Focus on the dominant term
2. **Consider trade-offs**: Time vs. space complexity
3. **Use appropriate data structures**: Arrays, hash tables, trees
4. **Apply algorithmic techniques**: Divide and conquer, dynamic programming
5. **Analyze worst-case scenarios**: Ensure robust performance
